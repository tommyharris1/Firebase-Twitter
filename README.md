This was one of the projects that I created during my undergraduate senior year at the University of Delaware.

The main objective of the project was to create a "micro" version of Twitter as a web application.
The course that the project pertains to is CPEG 470 / CISC 472 - Web App Security and
the course's instructor is Prof. Andy Novocin.
